Hi fellas,

This is a Credit Card Fraud Detection Project Using the "creditcard.csv" dataset.

In this project you'll see the techniques like undersampling and oversampling using smote method from imblearn library.

Using the different algorithms like linearRegresssion, DecisionTreeClassifier and RandomForestClassifier

I've built this model which gives on an average accuracy of 95%+ and which can be used to determined if the specific tansaction commited by a credit card is a fraud transaction or not.

Please Check out this project.
